        <h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
        <p>
            While HTML and CSS are not really programming languages  but they are the backbone for web development and every web developer
            must learn them.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML provides the structure while CSS provides the style and helps them to look better and more visually appealing.
            If you want to become a serious frontend developer then you must master these two in 2022.
         </p> 
         <p>
            The good thing about them is that you can easily master them in a few weeks and they are relatively easier to learn as well.

         </p>
         <p>
           If you need a course, I highly recommend the Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3 course by Jonas Schmedtmann
           Udemy course to start with. It provides the easiest way to learn modern web design, HTML5, and CSS3 step-by-step from scratch with
           a huge project.

         <a name="JavaScript"></a>
         <h2>JavaScript</h2>
         <p>
            In this list, JavaScript is the only language that serves both the server and client sides. Like HTML and CSS, JavaScript plays a
            core role in programming user-friendly and interactive front end of most websites, regardless of scales and complexity.
         </p>
         <p>
            So, in many surveys of Stack Overflow, GitHub and Hired, it always remains its leading position in top commonly used coding
            languages.
         </p>
         <p>
            In terms of server-side development,  JavaScript is a high-level programming language with multi-paradigm features, 
            dynamic typing and numerous libraries or frameworks such as Node. js, React or Vue.js that are compatible to multiple
            operating systems.

         <h2>Phython</h2>
         <p>
            Python is a high-level, yet beginner-friendly language, due to its straightforward syntax and support of various libraries or tools. 
            Additionally, it can work well as a scripting or object-oriented language and has strong typing, so the process of debugging is much faster.
         </p>
         <p>
            In the field of webs, Python is one of the best back-end web development languages and such Python web development projects
            as Spotify or Instagram using the Django framework written in this language. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Though processing faster than PHP, Python’s speed is still slower than C/C++ and Java.
             So the language does not suit Real-time apps, mobile apps or memory-intensive apps
         </p>
         <a href="#WDL">Go to top</a>
         <a name="C#"></a>
         <h2>C#</h2>
         <p>
            Compared to other web programming languages, C# is more special because Microsoft initially developed it for the .NET framework.
             So getting involved in C# web development means that developers will be restricted to that framework. So it only has libraries 
             and types available to add functionality only to the .NET.
         </p>
         <p>

            Having said that, the language still proves its popularity in programming many web apps or web API’s and developing video games on PC or Xbox.
         </p>
         <P>
            C#, or pronounced as C sharp, itself is multi-purpose and object-oriented. Similar to Java, it has strong typing and is independent on platforms because of CLR. 
         </P>

         <a name="PHP"></a>
         <h2>PHP</h2>
         <p>
            PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. It is a scripting language mainly used for the server-side of simple, dynamic sites and web apps, typically Drupal, WordPress, Flickr or Facebook.
            PHP web development has supported many free and open-source extensions including .NET, Apache or Bzip2, as well as allowed access to various databases such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and others.
         </p>
         <p>
            As some of PHP functions are similar to C language's, PHP developers can add functionality to PHP by writing more plug-ins (also called add-ons or extensions) in C. Moreover, until now, 
            PHP still retains basic Perl-like variables of the first version and the ability to be efficiently integrated into HTML. So PHP is easy for beginners to learn. 
         </p>
         <p>
            However, according to the 2022 survey of Hired, PHP is one of the “least loved coding languages” because it is not fun to program in. Indeed, in the competition with others, PHP proves a bit out-of-date 
            although its versions were released for improvements.
         </p>

         <a name="Ruby"></a>
         <h2>Ruby</h2>
         <p>
            When hearing of Ruby on Rails web development, some often think Ruby as an abbreviation of Ruby on Rails. But the latter is effectively a common web framework written in Ruby, with typical projects on Airbnb,
            GitHub or CodeAcademy. 
         </p>
         <p>
            The language itself is high-level and purely object-oriented, which means “every value is an object” and no primitive data types are available in Ruby. It also features strong, dynamic typing and automatic garbage
            collection - a form to manage memory.
         </p>
         <p>
            Ruby's syntax is comparatively similar to that of Python and Perl and quite flexible. Although this makes Ruby easy for coders to read, it can easily produce unpredictable run-time flaws that are hard to debug.
